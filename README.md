Brain-games:
These are five console games:
• Brain-even - you need to determine the number for parity.
• Brain-calc - you need to calculate a pair of numbers.
• Brain-gcd - you need to calculate and output the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
• Brain-prime - you need to determine a prime number or not a prime number.
• Brain-progression - you need to identify the hidden number.

Answer the questions and by typing three correct answers without mistakes you will win!

GOOD LUCK!
